HBBA - Hybrid Behavior-Based Architecture
=========================================

This is the (in progress) implementation of HBBA, the robot control architecture
built at 3IT-IntRoLab (Université de Sherbrooke).
It has been built with ROS and our robots (IRL-1/TR and /AZ3 variants) in mind,
but has been designed to be compatible with various platforms.

For any information, you can contact me, François Ferland
