# We're evaluating two ways of describing strategies in YAML. No parsing code
# has been developed yet. We're leaning on the first one.
#
# The loader would look for the "strategies" namespace. Then, each sub-namespace
# is a strategy. The namespace name is the id, and we look for 2 specific
# sub-namespaces: utility and cost, and 2 string parameters: bringup and
# bringdown. Utility and cost namespaces contain a list of parameters where the
# key is the id of the resource and the value its cost or utility effect.
strategies:
  goto1:
    utility:
      goto: 1
    cost:
      cpu: 10
      planner: 1 
    bringup: '
      msg = "goto1_up";
      print(msg);'
    bringdown: '
      print("goto1_dn");'

  strat2: 
    id: 'goto1'
    utility: [
      {id: 'goto', value: 1}
    ]
    cost: [
      {id: 'cpu', value: 10},
      {id: 'planner', value: 1}
    ]
    bringup: 'print("goto1_up")'
    bringdown: 'print("goto1_dn")'
