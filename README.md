HBBA - Hybrid Behavior-Based Architecture
=========================================

This is the (in progress) implementation of HBBA, the robot control architecture
built at 3IT-IntRoLab (Universit√© de Sherbrooke).
It has been built with ROS and our robots (IRL-1/TR and /AZ3 variants) in mind,
but has been designed to be compatible with various platforms.

To build the Intention Translator, which relies on Google or-tools, you need to
install these packages (on Ubuntu 14.04):

 - bison
 - flex
 - python-setuptools
 - python-dev
 - autoconf
 - libtool
 - zlib1g-dev
 - texinfo
 - gawk 
 - g++
 - curl
 - texlive
 - subversion
 - make
 - gettext

Furthermore, libv8-dev is required by the IW Script Engine.
